# Pot Hole Detection using Transfer Learning and CNN
Using deep learning and transfer learning techniques to solve the binary image classification problem of pothole detection by adopting an accurate model for savings in training time and computational efficiency.

## CNN Transfer Learning
### Convolutional Base
Pre-trained weights from **VGG16**

### Classifiers
  - Fully-connected Layer
  - Global Average Pooling
  - Linear Support Vector Machine

## Installation Requirements
### Environment
We recommend having a Linux or macOS development environment for convenience although, it would run in Windows. We recommend using Anaconda to manage your packages.
Install Python 3 (version >= 3.7.3 recommended), along with pip.

### Dependencies
- [ ] Include frameworks, libraries, language, etc
- [ ] Include version

## Instructions
- [ ] Step-by-step guide to setup the environment
- [ ] Link to the dataset hosted as a drive link
- [ ] Modifications to the code to run on another system (like changes to the basedir variable)
- [ ] Running on jupyter
